EDP Interface
=============

- provide sample editor
- provide allele editor


Report Generator
================

- use sampleset


Assay Viewer
============

Alternative JS plotting library: flot, nvd3.org or dygraphs.com

Current opinion is to use dygraphs.com =>
pros:
    - zoom
    - annotation
    - maintained by Google people

nvd3.org
pros:
    - built on d3.js, so good entry point to study d3.js
cons:
    - no zoom yet (must have!)


Solutions:
    - use dygraphs.com for now, but may be change to nvd3.org/plain d3.js in the future


Database Scheme
===============

Need to provide a concrete class for Panel, because we need to provide more information
about the panel, such as primers used, nested state, binning adjustment, etc.
